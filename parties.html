                    <p class="center" style="font-weight: 300;font-size:1.5em;"> The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena  is a Maharashtrian Nationalist party based in Maharashtra and operates on the motto of "Sons of the Soil". It was founded on 9 March 2006 in Mumbai by Raj Thackeray after he left the Shiv Sena party due to differences with his paternal cousin Uddhav Thackeray and to his sidelining by the Shiv Sena in major decisions like distribution of election tickets.
                        The party was founded by Raj Thackeray, nephew of late Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray. Raj Thackeray resigned from his uncle's party in January 2006 and announced his intention to start a new political party. The reason given by him for breaking away from the Shiv Sena was that the latter was "run by petty clerks" because of which it had "fallen from its former glory". Also Thackeray declared his motive of building a political awareness for the development related issues of the state and giving them a center stage in national politics.

					Aam Aadmi Party is an Indian political party, formally launched on 26 November 2012 and is currently the ruling party of Delhi. It came into existence following differences between the activists Arvind Kejriwal and Anna Hazare regarding whether or not to politicise the popular India Against Corruption movement that had been demanding a Jan Lokpal Bill since 2011. Hazare preferred that the movement should remain politically unaligned while Kejriwal felt the failure of the agitation route necessitated a direct political involvement.

					In the 2015 Delhi Legislative Assembly election, AAP won 67 of the 70 seats available. Its chief opponent, the Bhartiya Janta Party, was reduced to three seats, while the Indian National Congress was reduced to zero.
